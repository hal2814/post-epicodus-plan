## Biggest Priorities

* #### Continue work on Ruby Gem project (working title)
  -_I plan for my capstone project to be a capstone of my early career as a developer, I want to continue to add to this to not only display my passion for programming but also as a personal goal to create a useful open source tool that others may someday use in their own projects._
* #### Update Github readmes to look professional at least once per day until they are all done
  -_I often find that a project does not mean much if someone cannot understand it. I want anyone who looks at highlighted projects in my Github to understand the intent and purpose of a project when looking at it._
* #### Find interesting tech companies to apply to, and go through necessary steps to apply and contact them.
  -_It will be important to discover companies that I would find to be a good fit for me as well as me being a good fit for them. I would like to find developers that have similar interests and goals in programming._
