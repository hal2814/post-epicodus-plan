* Write at least two recommendations every week on Linkedin for connections I know
* Update Github readmes to look professional at least once per day until they are all done
* Look for Meetups to go to every week.
* Check in with class each week, arrange meetings
* Practice Big O notation, recursion, and other logic problems each week.


## Biggest Priorities

* Continue work on Ruby Gem project (working title)
  -_I plan for my capstone project to be a capstone of my early career as a developer, I want to continue to add to this to not only display my passion for programming but also as a personal goal to create a useful open source tool that others may someday use in their own projects._
* Update Github readmes to look professional at least once per day until they are all done
  -_I often find that a project does not mean much if someone cannot understand it. I want anyone who looks at highlighted projects in my Github to understand the intent and purpose of a project when looking at it._
* Find interesting tech companies to apply to, and go through necessary steps to apply and contact them.
  -_It will be important to discover companies that I would find to be a good fit for me as well as me being a good fit for them. I would like to find developers that have similar interests and goals in programming._
